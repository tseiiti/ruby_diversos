Title: Let's get GCD
Problem: Cody was doing his maths homework, suddenly he found a GCD(Greatest Comman divisor) problem. He is very lazy to do all the calculations for this exercise, so he just took his mobile and opened the Dcoder App, decided to code a program to find solution to GCD problem. You have to help him making this program, where you are presented with 2 integers, and you have to find their Greatest Comman Divisor.
The HCF or GCD of two integers is the largest integer that can exactly divide both numbers (without a remainder).
Input: Input contains 2 integers n1 and n2 separated by a newline.
Output: Print the GCD of n1 and n2
Constraints: 1â‰¤n1,n2â‰¤1000
Sample Input: 54
24
Sample Output: 
6
